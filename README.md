# DeSci Yield DeFi: Transforming Academic Contributions into Financial Assets 🚀

DeSci Yield DeFi is an innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology to enable users to stake their contributions in decentralized science (DeSci) platforms and earn yields. This protocol allows users to convert intangible academic contributions—like submitted encrypted data and peer reviews—into quantifiable financial assets, thus creating a bridge between academia and finance in a secure and privacy-preserving manner.

## The Challenge: Bridging Academia and Finance 🔗

In the current landscape, contributions to DeSci projects often go unrecognized in financial terms. Researchers and contributors face the challenge of having no tangible method to monetize their academic efforts. This lack of recognition not only hinders individual motivation but also slows down the growth of scientific collaboration. By providing a platform where these contributions can be staked and rewarded, DeSci Yield DeFi addresses a crucial gap, enabling users to see real returns on their intellectual investments.

## How Zama's FHE Provides a Solution 🔒

The DeSci Yield DeFi protocol utilizes **Zama's open-source libraries**, including the **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, and the **zama-fhe SDK**, to implement Fully Homomorphic Encryption. This ensures that user contributions can be verified and utilized for yield calculations without exposing sensitive data. The application of FHE allows for complex calculations to be performed while keeping the underlying data confidential. This capability is pivotal for maintaining the privacy of academic contributions while still enabling a transparent reward mechanism.

## Core Functionalities of DeSci Yield DeFi 🌟

- **Privacy-Preserving Staking**: Users can stake their academic contributions securely without revealing their data.
- **Homomorphically Computed Yields**: Yields are calculated based on encrypted contributions, ensuring privacy and integrity.
- **Asset Transformation**: Intangible academic contributions are converted into quantifiable financial assets, incentivizing participation in DeSci projects.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An easy-to-navigate staking interface that seamlessly integrates with DeSci contribution linkers.

## Technology Stack 🛠️

- **Smart Contract Framework**: Solidity
- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum
- **Confidential Computing**: Zama's FHE SDK (Concrete, TFHE-rs)
- **Development Environment**: Hardhat or Foundry

## Installation Guide 📦

To set up the DeSci Yield DeFi project, follow these instructions:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. You can download the latest version from the Node.js website.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will fetch the required Zama FHE libraries and other dependencies needed for the project.

**⚠️ Important**: Do not use `git clone` or any URLs to download the project. Ensure you have downloaded it through approved methods.

## Build & Run Instructions 🏗️

Once the installation is complete, you can build and run the project using the following commands:

1. To compile the smart contracts, run:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. To run the tests and ensure everything is functioning correctly, execute:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. Finally, to deploy the contract on a local network, use:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

4. You can start the frontend by navigating to the `frontend` folder and running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Example Code Snippet 💻

Here’s a simple example of how you might interact with the staking function in the DeSci Yield DeFi contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./DeSci_Yield_DeFi.sol";

contract UserInteraction {
    DeSci_Yield_DeFi yieldDeFi;

    constructor(address _yieldDeFiAddress) {
        yieldDeFi = DeSci_Yield_DeFi(_yieldDeFiAddress);
    }

    function stakeContribution(uint256 amount) public {
        // Require the user to approve the token transfer
        yieldDeFi.stake(amount);
    }

    function calculateYield() public view returns (uint256) {
        return yieldDeFi.getYield(msg.sender);
    }
}
```

In this code, we create a simple contract that interacts with the DeSci Yield DeFi protocol, allowing users to stake their contributions and calculate their yields using the features powered by Zama's FHE technology.
